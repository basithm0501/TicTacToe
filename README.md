# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against a computer opponent using the minimax algorithm.

## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) on the grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. In this project, you can play against a computer opponent that uses the minimax algorithm to make its moves.

The code is written in Python and uses the `Board` class to represent the game board and provide game-related functionalities.

## Requirements

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you need:

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
'''console
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
'''

2. Change into the project directory:
'''console
cd tic-tac-toe
'''

3. Run the game:
'''console
python tic_tac_toe.py
'''

4. Follow the prompts to play the game. Enter the row and column numbers to make your move.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 uses the symbol 'X', and Player 2 (computer opponent) uses the symbol 'O'.
3. Players take turns placing their symbols on empty cells of the grid.
4. The game ends when either one player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or the grid is full with no winner (a draw).
5. The computer opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make its moves and provide a challenging game.
